<b> Cloud Computing (AWS)</b>:  
08/05/2023 - 03/06/2023 
I have successfully completed my one-month AWS internship at SAMFAS LABS and hosted a website 
using Elastic Cloud Computing (EC<sub>2</sub>) to create the instance. The website is capable of handling a large 
number of requests by using AWS Lambda, which dynamically increases the number of servers based 
on the load. Many organizations generate huge amounts of data daily, and handling such enormous 
data efficiently can be challenging. This problem is overcome by using Simple Storage Service (S<sub>3</sub>), 
which also allows us to transfer data easily, even from one country to another. 

<b>Substation, Electrical Circuit Design, Industrial Automation, E-Cad, Basics of IOT & Solar PV Systems</b>: 
16/06/2020 â€“ 15/12/2020 
I have successfully completed my six-month Industrial training at NSIC (National Small Industries 
Corporation Ltd.) and learned to design single-phase and three-phase circuits. I also learned how to 
automate those designed circuits using different types of sensors (Industrial Automation). Since India 
is gifted with abundant sunlight, I also gained experience in generating conventional sources of energy 
using solar technology.
